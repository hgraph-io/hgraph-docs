There are also overage fees that can be applied.

**What does "Max RPS" mean?**\
This is the maximum number of Requests Per Second (RPS) that you can send to Hgraph APIs.

**What does "Surge Ready" mean?**\
From time to time, customers expect surges in RPS. With surge support, Hgraph can provide custom solutions for expected surges.
