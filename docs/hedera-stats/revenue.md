# Revenue

> *Note: Documentation for these "Hedera Stats" are currently being developed.*

Hedera’s revenue is calculated by summing the transaction fees collected across the mainnet. Every transaction pays fees to the consensus nodes, the staking account (0.0.800), the node rewards account (0.0.801) and the Hedera treasury (0.0.98). By examining each transaction, determining the total fee paid, and identifying which portions go to these accounts, Hedera can determine its total network revenue. This total can then be categorized by service type—Hedera Token Service (HTS), Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS), Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), and Other (including file and account operations)—providing a detailed breakdown of revenue sources.

## Methodology

### Transaction-Level Fee Analysis

Every transaction submitted to the Hedera mainnet incurs certain fees, which are distributed to various recipients.

    - **Consensus Nodes**: Nodes that reach consensus on the order of transactions and earn a portion of the transaction fee.
    - **Staking Account (0.0.800)**: An account designated for staking rewards. A portion of the fee goes here.
    - **Node Reward Account (0.0.801)**: An account designated for rewarding all active consensus nodes. A portion of the fee goes here.
    - **Hedera Treasury (0.0.98)**: The central treasury account on the network. Another portion of the fee is directed here.

### Data Inputs

To calculate revenue, each transaction's fee distribution must be known. This information can be obtained from the mirror node transaction records, which detail the fees paid and how they are allocated.

### Calculating Total Revenue

```
Total Revenue (HBAR) = Σ (Transaction Fees going to Consensus Nodes + Transaction Fees going to Staking Account + Transaction Fees going to Hedera Treasury)
```

In other words, for each transaction:

    - Identify the total fee charged.
    - Extract the portions of that fee allocated to consensus nodes, the staking account, and the treasury.
    - Sum all such portions across all transactions to get the total revenue.

### Breaking Down by Service Type

Hedera offers multiple services, and transactions can be grouped based on the type of service they utilize. To understand how different parts of the network contribute to revenue, categorize each transaction by service type:

    - **HTS (Hedera Token Service)**: Revenue from fees associated with token operations (creation, transfers, minting, etc.).
    - **HSCS (Hedera Smart Contract Service)**: Revenue from fees tied to smart contract operations (creation, calls, updates).
    - **HCS (Hedera Consensus Service)**: Revenue from fees generated by consensus message submissions.
    - **Other Services**: Revenue from all other transaction types, including file system (HFS), account-related transactions (e.g., create, update, delete), and HBAR transfers that are not categorized under HTS, HSCS, or HCS.

### Aggregating and Presenting Revenue

    - For each transaction, determine the total fee and identify which bucket it falls into (HTS, HSCS, HCS, or Other) based on its transaction type.
    - Aggregate the fees across all transactions over the chosen time period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
    - Sum the fees for each category to provide both a total revenue figure and a breakdown by service type.
