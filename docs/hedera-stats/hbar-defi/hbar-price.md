:::

Hedera Stat Name: **`avg_usd_conversion`**

## Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget and MEXC
- **Aggregation:**
  - The average of candlestick closing prices for a given period for the HBAR/USDT pair on the five major exchanges by trading volume was calculated.
  - The price is multiplied by 10,000 for integer representation for each time period.

## Data Representation
Each period represents the latest available HBAR price at the given timestamp. This metric is useful for tracking price fluctuations and market trends.

## Additional Notes
- HBAR price fluctuations can be influenced by market conditions, trading volume, and broader crypto trends.
- Future enhancements may include price history tracking, moving averages, and volatility analysis.
