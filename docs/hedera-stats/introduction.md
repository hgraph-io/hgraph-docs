# Introduction

Hgraph offers API access to various quantitative statistical measurements for the Hedera network based on open-sourced methodologies outlined in this documentation. These statistics leverage Hedera mirror node data, data computation, 3rd party data sources and Hgraph's GraphQL API and can be used for analysis in various metrics and KPIs. If you're looking to access the "Hedera Stats" via Hgraph's APIs, you can [get started here](https://hgraph.com/hedera). If you're looking to contribute to the "Hedera Stats" project on GitHub, [check out the repository](https://github.com/hgraph-io/hedera-stats).

## Why create Hedera Stats?

Understanding the health of the Hedera network is important. To measure this, we use things like TVL, revenue, active accounts, time to consensus and more. What's most important is ensuring the methodology used for these calculations are transparent and comprehensive to maintain consistency. It's also vital to ensure easy access to these data feeds via APIs. Hgraph's data infrastructure makes this possible.

## GitHub Repository

This repository contains the SQL code for these Hedera Stats queries as well as JSON to import a demo Grafana dashboard. It also has information regarding incremental update setup.

### Querying Statistics
You can dynamically fetch all available metrics using the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query AvailableMetrics {
  ecosystem_metric(distinct_on: name) {
    name
    description {
      description
      methodology
    }
  }
}
```

This will return all metric names and descriptions.

## Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### Why am I missing data on certain dates?

- If your query returns missing data for a certain timeframe, verify that you're querying the correct API endpoint.
- `hgraph.dev` is a staging environment and may not always contain complete data.
- `hgraph.io` is the production endpoint, and requires an API key.

### How do I check if a metric is available?

- Use the query below to list all available `ecosystem_metric` names:

```graphql
query AvailableMetrics {
  ecosystem_metric(distinct_on: name) {
    name
  }
}
```

### How do I improve query performance?

- Use `month` or `day` granularity instead of `hour` for large date ranges.
- Apply `limit` and `order_by` to reduce result size.
- Consider caching results if you're querying the same data frequently.
