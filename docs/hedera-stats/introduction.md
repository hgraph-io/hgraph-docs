# Introduction

Hgraph offers API access to various ecosystem health metrics for the Hedera network based on open-sourced methodologies. These ecosystem metrics leverage Hedera mirror node data, data computation and Hgraph's GraphQL API. If you're looking to access the "Hedera Stats" APIs, you can [create an Hgraph account](https://dashboard.hgraph.com) and start querying data. If you're looking to contribute to the "Hedera Stats" project on GitHub, [check out the repository](/).

## Why create Hedera Stats?

Understanding the health of the Hedera network is important. To measure this, we use things like TVL, revenue, active accounts, time to consensus and more. What's most important is ensuring the methodology used for these calculations are transparent and comprehensive to maintain consistency. It's also vital to ensure easy access to these ecosystem metric data feeds via APIs. Hgraph's data infrastructure makes this possible.
