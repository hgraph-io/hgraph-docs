# Introduction

Hgraph offers API access to various quantitative statistical measurements for the Hedera network based on open-sourced methodologies outlined in this documentation. These statistics leverage Hedera mirror node data, data computation, 3rd party data sources and Hgraph's GraphQL API and can be used for analysis in various metrics and KPIs. If you're looking to access the "Hedera Stats" via Hgraph's APIs, you can [get started here](https://hgraph.com/hedera). If you're looking to contribute to the "Hedera Stats" project on GitHub, [check out the repository](https://github.com/hgraph-io/hedera-stats).

## Why create Hedera Stats?

Understanding the health of the Hedera network is important. To measure this, we use things like TVL, revenue, active accounts, time to consensus and more. What's most important is ensuring the methodology used for these calculations are transparent and comprehensive to maintain consistency. It's also vital to ensure easy access to these data feeds via APIs. Hgraph's data infrastructure makes this possible.

## GitHub Repository

This repository contains the SQL code for these Hedera Stats queries as well as JSON to import a demo Grafana dashboard. It also has information regarding incremental update setup.
