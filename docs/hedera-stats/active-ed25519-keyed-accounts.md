# Active Ed25519 Keyed Accounts

Accounts secured by Hedera's native **Ed25519** key type that initiate at least one successful transaction during the chosen timeframe. These users typically rely on standard Hedera wallets and SDKs.

:::note Hedera Data Access
To access this Hedera network statistic ([and others](/category/hedera-stats/)) via Hgraph's GraphQL & REST APIs, [get started here](https://www.hgraph.com/hedera).
:::

## Overview
The total count of unique accounts that:

1. Have an Ed25519 public key on record.
2. Successfully pay for at least one transaction in the measurement window.

Ed25519 keys are Hedera's default account type, so this metric indicates general user activity excluding ECDSAâ€‘based wallets.

## Methodology
1. Query the mirror node `entity` table for accounts whose `key` field contains an Ed25519 public key.
2. Join these accounts with the `transaction` table via `payer_account_id`.
3. Count distinct accounts with `result = 22` (success) during the requested period.
4. Ignore accounts using other key algorithms.
