# Transactions Per Second (TPS)

## Overview
Transactions Per Second (TPS) measures the number of transactions processed by the Hedera network within a given period. This metric provides insights into network activity, scalability, and overall transaction throughput.

## Methodology
- **Data Source:** Transactions are retrieved from the Hedera transaction dataset.
- **Aggregation:**
  - Transactions are grouped by the selected period (e.g., second, minute, hour, day).
  - The total transaction count is divided by the number of seconds in the period to compute TPS.

## Data Representation
Each period represents the average number of transactions processed per second within that timeframe. This allows users to analyze network load and scalability trends over time.

## Additional Notes
- TPS is a key performance indicator for blockchain networks, showing real-time processing capability.

## API Endpoint
A dedicated API endpoint from Hgraph will be available.

**Endpoint:** `[Placeholder for API]`
