# Versioning

This Software Development Kit (SDK) is actively being developed in conjunction with the [Hgraph API](https://hgraph.com) to ensure seamless integration and compatibility between the two. We are committed to adopting [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) standards, which will provide clear and predictable updates, making it easier for developers to manage dependencies and stay informed about changes.

:::note Pin exact versions
Before we release version 1.0, updates may introduce breaking changes as we refine the software. To maintain stability in production, we recommend pinning dependencies to an exact version using `--save-exact` when installing the package.
