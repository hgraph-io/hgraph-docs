# Examples & Use Cases

Discover what's possible with the Hgraph MCP Server through real-world examples and use cases.

## Quick Start - Try Your First Query

Once your MCP connector is configured, test the connection with this simple query:

**"What is the current total supply of HBAR?"**

If successful, you'll see Hedera network data returned directly in your chat. This confirms your MCP is working correctly!

## Featured Examples

### üìä Analyst: Monthly Reporting

**Use Case:** Generate comprehensive network reports for stakeholders

**Prompt:**
```
Generate a monthly report showing key Hedera network metrics.
Provide this as a document/artifact.
```

*The MCP server will query multiple data sources, aggregate metrics, and return formatted results ready for your reports.*

**Try these variations:**
- "Show me transaction volume trends for the past 30 days"
- "What were the top 10 most active accounts this month?"
- "Generate a DeFi ecosystem report with TVL and trading volumes"

### üîç Developer: Token Discovery

**Use Case:** Find and analyze new tokens on the network

**Prompt:**
```
Get the 5 latest ERC-20 tokens on Hedera with a metadata
reliability score of 0.75 or greater
```

*Perfect for exploring new tokens, analyzing deployment patterns, and filtering by quality metrics with precise queries.*

**Try these variations:**
- "Show me all NFT collections deployed in the last week"
- "Find tokens with more than 1000 holders"
- "List smart contracts deployed by account 0.0.XYZ"

### üíº Hedera Enthusiast: Portfolio Analysis

**Use Case:** Track and analyze your holdings

**Prompt:**
```
Please give me a portfolio breakdown of fungible and non-fungible
tokens for account 0.0.XYZ and recent transfer activity.
```

*Check your portfolio, track NFT collections, and monitor account activity from anywhere.*

**Try these variations:**
- "What's my account's transaction history for the past 7 days?"
- "Show me all NFTs owned by account 0.0.XYZ"
- "Calculate the total USD value of tokens in account 0.0.XYZ"

## More Prompt Ideas

## Advanced Query Patterns

### Combining Multiple Data Points
```
Show me the top 5 accounts by HBAR balance,
then display their token holdings and recent transactions
```

### Time-Series Analysis
```
Create a weekly breakdown of network fees collected
for the past 3 months, formatted as a table
```

### Cross-Reference Queries
```
Find all accounts that hold both USDC and HBARX tokens,
sorted by total portfolio value
```

### Filtered Aggregations
```
Calculate the total NFT trading volume for collections
with more than 100 unique holders
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific with entity IDs**: Use the format `0.0.XYZ` for accounts, tokens, and contracts
2. **Include time ranges**: Specify "today", "past week", "last 30 days" for time-bound queries
3. **Request specific formats**: Ask for tables, CSVs, or markdown for structured data
4. **Use proper terminology**: "Treasury account", "consensus timestamp", "token association"
5. **Chain queries logically**: Start broad, then narrow down with follow-up questions

## Integration Ideas

### Automated Reporting
Set up recurring prompts to generate daily/weekly reports on key metrics.

### Portfolio Tracking
Create a standardized prompt template for checking multiple accounts.

### Market Analysis
Combine multiple data points to identify trends and opportunities.

### Audit & Compliance
Use historical queries to track fund movements and verify transactions.
