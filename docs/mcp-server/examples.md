# Examples & Use Cases

Discover what's possible with the Hgraph MCP Server through real-world examples and use cases.

## Quick Start - Try Your First Query

Once your MCP connector is configured, test the connection with this simple query:

**"What is the current total supply of HBAR?"**

If successful, you'll see Hedera network data returned directly in your chat. This confirms your MCP is working correctly!

## Prompt Examples

### Analyst: Monthly Reporting in Claude Desktop

**Prompt:** "Generate a monthly report showing key Hedera network metrics. Provide this as a document/artifact."

*The MCP server will query multiple data sources, aggregate metrics, and return formatted results ready for your reports.*

### Developer: Token Discovery in Claude Code

**Prompt:** "Get the 5 latest ERC-20 tokens on Hedera with a metadata reliability score of 0.75 or greater"

*Perfect for exploring new tokens, analyzing deployment patterns, and filtering by quality metrics with precise queries.*

### Hedera Enthusiast: Portfolio Analysis on ChatGPT Mobile

**Prompt:** "Please give me a portfolio breakdown of fungible and non-fungible tokens for account 0.0.XYZ and recent transfer activity."
