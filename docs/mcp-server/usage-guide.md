# Usage Tips & Best Practices

Maximize your experience with the Hgraph MCP Server by following these guidelines and best practices.

## Usage Tips

### üéØ Be Specific with Your Queries

Use entity IDs (like `0.0.XYZ` for accounts), time ranges, and clear metrics for best results. The more specific your prompt, the more accurate the data.

**Good prompt:**
```
Show me HBAR transfers over 10,000 HBAR from account 0.0.98
in the past 24 hours
```

**Less effective:**
```
Show me large transfers
```

### üîç Explore the Underlying Queries

Ask the AI to show you the GraphQL or SQL queries it's using. This transparency helps you understand the data and learn query patterns.

**Example:**
```
Show me the top 5 token holders for USDC and display
the GraphQL query you used
```

### üìä Combine with AI Capabilities

Request charts, dashboards, CSV exports, or markdown tables. The AI can transform raw blockchain data into any format you need.

**Format examples:**
- "Create a markdown table of the top 10 accounts by balance"
- "Generate a CSV of all transactions from today"
- "Build a dashboard showing network metrics"
- "Create a pie chart of token distribution"

### üöÄ Start with Context

The MCP automatically loads essential schemas, but you can ask for additional examples or explore specific data types for deeper insights.

**Context-building prompts:**
- "What data is available for NFT collections?"
- "Show me available metrics for DeFi protocols"
- "What transaction types can I query?"

### üìö Follow Prompting Best Practices

For optimal results, refer to platform-specific guides:
- [Claude's prompting guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview)
- [OpenAI's prompt engineering strategies](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)

## Verifying Information

Since LLMs can occasionally generate inaccurate information (known as "hallucination"), we recommend verifying critical data during this beta phase.

### How to Verify

1. **Cross-reference with Hgraph Dashboard**
   - Visit [dashboard.hgraph.com](https://dashboard.hgraph.com)
   - Run the same queries generated by your AI assistant
   - Compare results for accuracy

2. **Check Multiple Sources**
   - Compare with [HashScan explorer](https://hashscan.io)
   - Verify token data on project websites
   - Cross-check DeFi metrics with protocol dashboards

3. **Request Query Validation**
   - Ask: "Show me the exact query you're using"
   - Ask: "Can you verify this data with a second query?"
   - Ask: "What's the data source for this information?"

### When to Verify

Always verify when:
- Making financial decisions
- Reporting official statistics
- Debugging smart contracts
- Auditing transactions
- Publishing research

## Safety & Security

The Hgraph MCP Server prioritizes security and safety through multiple layers of protection:

### Read-Only Operations

The server **cannot**:
- Write data to the Hedera network
- Sign transactions
- Modify blockchain state
- Access private keys
- Execute smart contracts

All operations are strictly read-only queries.

### Robust Security Features

- **Input validation**: All queries validated using strict schemas
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse and overload
- **Query timeouts**: Resource protection (10-second default)
- **SQL injection prevention**: Prepared statements only
- **Automatic redaction**: Sensitive data removed from logs
- **Allowlisted RPC methods**: Only safe read operations permitted

### Data Protection

We **never** request or handle:
- Private keys or seed phrases
- Wallet passwords
- Authentication credentials (beyond your API key)
- Personal information

The MCP server only accesses publicly available blockchain data.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Performance Optimization

**Slow queries?**
- Add specific time ranges to limit data
- Use account/token IDs instead of searching by name
- Request smaller datasets and paginate if needed

**Timeout errors?**
- Break complex queries into smaller parts
- Add filters to reduce data volume
- Specify exact fields needed instead of "all data"

### Data Accuracy

**Unexpected results?**
- Verify entity IDs are correct (0.0.X format)
- Check timestamp formats (nanoseconds vs seconds)
- Ensure token decimals are properly handled

**Missing data?**
- Confirm the entity exists on mainnet
- Check if data is recent (may need time to index)
- Verify your query timeframe includes the data

### Query Patterns

**Better query structure:**
```
# Good: Specific and bounded
"Show me HBAR transfers over 1000 HBAR between
accounts 0.0.98 and 0.0.1001 in the past 7 days"

# Better: With output format
"Show me HBAR transfers over 1000 HBAR between
accounts 0.0.98 and 0.0.1001 in the past 7 days,
formatted as a markdown table with timestamp,
amount, and transaction ID"
```

## Advanced Tips

### Batch Operations
Instead of multiple individual queries, combine related requests:
```
For account 0.0.12345:
1. Show current HBAR balance
2. List all token balances
3. Show last 10 transactions
4. Calculate total fees paid this month
```

### Time-Series Analysis
Leverage the AI's ability to aggregate over time:
```
Create a daily breakdown of:
- Transaction count
- Unique active accounts
- Total fees collected
For the past 30 days, displayed as a line chart
```

### Cross-Reference Data
Connect multiple data points for insights:
```
Find correlations between:
- HBAR price movements
- Network transaction volume
- New account creation rate
Over the past quarter
```

## Best Practices Summary

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use specific entity IDs and time ranges
- Verify critical information independently
- Request structured output formats
- Break complex queries into steps
- Save useful query patterns for reuse

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Share API keys or sensitive information
- Rely on AI for transaction signing
- Trust hallucinated entity IDs
- Request write operations
- Ignore verification for critical data
