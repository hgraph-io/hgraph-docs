# Hgraph Beta MCP & AI App Connectors  

![Hgraph MCP Server Hero Image](./hgraph-mcp-docs-hero.jpg)

## Connect AI to Hedera Blockchain Data

The Hgraph MCP Server connects AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT directly to [Hedera](https://hedera.com) blockchain data. Query the network using natural language—no coding required. AI assistants have general blockchain knowledge but cannot access live, network-specific data on their own—they need a real-time connection to Hedera's network, which is what this MCP connector provides.

Built by [Hgraph](https://hgraph.com), we provide enriched data from bare metal Hedera mirror nodes with real-time updates, DeFi metrics, and comprehensive network analytics.

**What you can do:**

- **✘ Before** - "Give me a portfolio breakdown of my Hedera account" → "I don't have access to current Hedera network mirror node data"
- **✓ After** - "Give me a portfolio breakdown of my Hedera account" → *Real-time answer with current metrics, activity and holdings*

Ask questions in plain English, get live blockchain data. No APIs, no manual queries, no coding, no complexity.

## Platform Comparison {#platforms}

**Claude (Recommended)**: Native MCP support, works across web/desktop/mobile, easiest setup.

**ChatGPT**: Requires Developer Mode (beta feature), web and mobile supported, slightly more setup steps.

**More platforms coming**: We're working on support for additional AI platforms and custom solutions.

:::note Technical Requirement for Other Clients
The Hgraph MCP Server requires clients that support **Streamable HTTP transport** (MCP spec 2025-06-18). This server does not support the deprecated dual-endpoint SSE transport. All major LLM platforms (Claude, ChatGPT) support Streamable HTTP by default.
