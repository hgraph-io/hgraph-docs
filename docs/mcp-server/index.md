## Unlock Hedera Blockchain Data in Your AI Assistant

The Hgraph MCP Server is a powerful bridge that connects AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT directly to [Hedera](https://hedera.com) network data. Built by [Hgraph](https://hgraph.com), a company focused on accelerating blockchain data access, this Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables natural language queries to instantly retrieve on-chain information from Hederaâ€”one of the fastest, most decentralized networks with a rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem.

Hgraph operates bare metal Hedera mirror nodes for lightning-fast data access, serving all mirror node data back to genesis with real-time updates. We provide enriched data through [Hedera Stats](https://docs.hgraph.com/hedera-stats) for comprehensive network analytics and KPIs, plus our [ERC Token Indexer](https://docs.hgraph.com/erc-token-data/overview) for real-time ERC-20 and ERC-721 token data. This means your AI assistant has access to the most reliable and comprehensive Hedera data available.

Whether you're an analyst generating reports, a developer building complex queries, or a Hedera enthusiast exploring the ecosystem, the Hgraph MCP Server transforms how you interact with blockchain dataâ€”no coding required, just conversation.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard created by Anthropic and announced in November 2024. MCP standardizes how AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools, replacing fragmented integrations with a universal protocol. [Learn more about MCP â†’](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)

Think of MCP as a universal translator between AI and data. Before MCP, each AI platform needed custom integrations for every data source. Now, any MCP-compliant server works with any MCP-enabled AI assistant, creating an ecosystem of interoperable tools.

Hgraph chose to implement MCP because it aligns perfectly with our mission: making blockchain data accessible to everyone. By building on this open standard, we ensure the Hgraph MCP Server will work with current and future AI platforms, providing long-term value to the Hedera community.

5. ChatGPT automatically calls the appropriate Hgraph tools

*Note: MCP servers do not work in ChatGPT's Deep Research mode. MCP servers do not currently work in ChatGPT Desktop.*

*Reminder: Once configured in ChatGPT web, the Hgraph MCP will work on the ChatGPT mobile app when signed into the same account.*

### Set Up in Claude Code CLI

Claude Code provides the most powerful MCP experience for developers and technical users.

![Claude Code MCP Setup](./claudecode.png)

1. Install Claude Code ([installation guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started))
2. Complete any IDE-specific configurations
3. Add the Hgraph MCP connector via terminal:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http hgraph https://mainnet.hedera.api.hgraph.io/v1/<YOUR-HGRAPH-API-KEY>/mcp
   ```
4. Restart Claude Code:
   - VS Code: Reload window (Cmd/Ctrl+R)
   - Terminal: Exit and restart your session
5. Verify the connection:
   ```bash
   claude mcp list
   ```
   You should see `hgraph` in the list of connected MCPs

#### How to use Hgraph MCP in Claude Code CLI

Simply start a conversation and write prompts that specify Hedera data queries. Claude Code automatically calls the appropriate Hgraph tools.

*Tip: To avoid approving every Hgraph tool call, configure auto-approval by adding to your allowlist:*
```bash
# Add Hgraph tools to auto-approval list
claude config set allowlist "mcp__hgraph__*"
```

### Set up in Other LLM Apps

The Hgraph MCP Server is fully MCP-compliant and may work with other AI applications and CLIs that support the protocol. While we haven't tested every platform, we encourage experimentation and welcome feedback on your experiences. Custom applications can also integrate the MCP server, though results may vary depending on implementation.

### Quick Start - Try Your First Query

Once your MCP connector is configured, test the connection with this simple query:

**"What is the current total supply of HBAR?"**

If successful, you'll see Hedera network data returned directly in your chat. Now you can explore more complex queries from our examples above!

---

## Usage Tips & Ideas

- **Be specific with your queries**: Use entity IDs (like 0.0.XYZ for accounts), time ranges, and clear metrics for best results. The more specific your prompt, the more accurate the data.

- **Explore the underlying queries**: Ask the AI to show you the GraphQL or SQL queries it's using. This transparency helps you understand the data and learn query patterns.

- **Combine with AI capabilities**: Request charts, dashboards, CSV exports, or markdown tables. The AI can transform raw blockchain data into any format you need.

- **Start with context**: The MCP automatically loads essential schemas, but you can ask for additional examples or explore specific data types for deeper insights.

- **Follow prompting best practices**: For optimal results, refer to [Claude's prompting guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) or [OpenAI's prompt engineering strategies](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).

---

## Verifying Information

Since LLMs can occasionally generate inaccurate information (known as "hallucination"), we recommend verifying critical data during this beta phase. Cross-reference important information with the [Hgraph Dashboard](https://dashboard.hgraph.com), where you can run the same queries generated by your AI assistant for confirmation. This extra verification step ensures accuracy for important decisions while we continue to refine and improve the service.

---

## Safety

The Hgraph MCP Server prioritizes security and safety through multiple layers of protection:

**Read-Only Operations**: The server cannot write data to the Hedera network, sign transactions, or modify any blockchain state. All operations are strictly read-only queries.

**Robust Security Features**:
- Input validation on all queries using strict schemas
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Query timeouts for resource protection
- SQL injection prevention through prepared statements
- Automatic redaction of sensitive data in logs
- Allowlisted RPC methods only

**Data Protection**: We never request or handle private keys, seed phrases, or authentication credentials beyond your API key. The MCP server only accesses publicly available blockchain data.
