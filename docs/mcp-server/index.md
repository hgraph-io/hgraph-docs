## Unlock Hedera Blockchain Data in Your AI Assistant

The Hgraph MCP Server is a powerful bridge that connects AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT directly to [Hedera](https://hedera.com) network data. Built by [Hgraph](https://hgraph.com), a company focused on accelerating blockchain data access, this Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables natural language queries to instantly retrieve on-chain information from Hedera—one of the fastest, most decentralized networks with a rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem.

Hgraph operates bare metal Hedera mirror nodes for lightning-fast data access, serving all mirror node data back to genesis with real-time updates. We provide enriched data through [Hedera Stats](/hedera-stats) for comprehensive network analytics and KPIs, plus our [ERC Token Indexer](/erc-token-data/overview) for real-time ERC-20 and ERC-721 token data. This means your AI assistant has access to the most reliable and comprehensive Hedera data available.

Whether you're an analyst generating reports, a developer building complex queries, or a Hedera enthusiast exploring the ecosystem, the Hgraph MCP Server transforms how you interact with blockchain data—no coding required, just conversation.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard created by Anthropic and announced in November 2024. MCP standardizes how AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools, replacing fragmented integrations with a universal protocol. [Learn more about MCP →](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)

Think of MCP as a universal translator between AI and data. Before MCP, each AI platform needed custom integrations for every data source. Now, any MCP-compliant server works with any MCP-enabled AI assistant, creating an ecosystem of interoperable tools.

Hgraph chose to implement MCP because it aligns perfectly with our mission: making blockchain data accessible to everyone. By building on this open standard, we ensure the Hgraph MCP Server will work with current and future AI platforms, providing long-term value to the Hedera community.
