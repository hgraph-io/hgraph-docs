# GraphQL API Overview

## What is the GraphQL API?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows precise data fetching with a single endpoint, reducing unnecessary data transfer. Its strong type system enables efficient, flexible queries and real-time updates, making it ideal for complex web and mobile applications. This self-documenting approach simplifies development, allowing for rapid frontend changes without backend adjustments, streamlining the creation of responsive, data-driven applications.
